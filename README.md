The purpose of this analysis is to create summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type using Pandas and Matplotlib.

The analysis will be performed with the use of line graph that it will give an insight to the weekly fares for each city to help PyBer to make reliable decisions.

## Results:

### Below is a snapshot of ride-sharing by their city type:

The Urban city have the highest number of rides with the lowest average fare of fare per ride and lowest average fare per Driver. This imply that Pyber generates more revenue from the urban city using a low cost strategy while there is huge volume to enable them 

The Rural city  average fare per ride and the average fare per Driver is pretty high, this is expected because the demand for rides is relatively low.

The Suburban city  average fare per ride and the average fare per Driver is a bit high.


### Below is a snapshot of the difference in ride sharing data among different city types starting January 1, 2019 to April 29, 2019

The three cities experienced increased total fare in the week 2019-02-24 in February. 

The Rural city experience increased total ride fare in the week 2019-04-14 and the lowest in 2019-01-13

Urban City experienced increased total ride fare in 2019-03-10 and the lowest in 2019-01-06

Suburban city experienced increased total fare in 2019-04-28 and the lowest 2019-01-06


## Summary:
The above results has given us the insight to make three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
1. The week with the highest total fare for all the cities was in February, this could be as a result of people returning  back to the country from vacation. this implies there was high demand for Pyber rides during this period. To increase ride fares in the three cities, discounts can be offered to both new and existing customers, Drivers incentives can also be reviewed upward since there is a relationship bewtweem the number of rides and the the taotal fares.
2. The three cities each have their lowest total fares in a week in January, promotions like discounts of fees can be presented during this period to encourage their customers.
3. For the week where different cities recorded increased total fare, Driver fare per ride can be increased to encourage more Drivers on the road in these cities during their peak period.
